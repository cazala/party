# WebGPU Migration Roadmap

This directory contains the complete roadmap for migrating the party physics library from CPU-based computation to WebGPU, enabling massive particle simulations with thousands of particles.

## Migration Overview

The migration follows a gradual, testable approach that maintains API compatibility while adding WebGPU acceleration. Each issue can be implemented and tested independently, allowing for incremental performance improvements.

### Key Benefits
- **Scale**: Support for 10k+ particles (currently struggles above 1k)
- **Performance**: 10-50x speedup for compute-heavy operations
- **Compatibility**: Seamless fallback to CPU when WebGPU unavailable
- **Future-proof**: Built on modern GPU compute standards

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Issues #01-#02)
Establishes WebGPU infrastructure and basic acceleration capabilities.
- **Goal**: Basic WebGPU pipeline with simple forces
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Outcome**: Measurable performance improvement for basic simulations

### **Phase 2: Core Forces** (Issues #03-#06) 
Migrates the most computationally expensive forces to GPU.
- **Goal**: Major performance gains for complex simulations
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  
- **Outcome**: Support for 10k+ particles with fluid dynamics and flocking

### **Phase 3: Integration** (Issues #07-#09)
Optimizes rendering pipeline and polishes user experience.
- **Goal**: Production-ready WebGPU backend
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- **Outcome**: Seamless user experience with maximum performance

## Issue Dependencies

```
#01 Foundation
├── #02 Spatial Grid
├── #03 Fluid Dynamics*
├── #04 Collision Detection*  
├── #05 Behavior Forces*
├── #06 Joint Constraints*
└── #07 Rendering

#08 Playground Integration** 
└── #09 Optimization & Polish**

* Requires #01 and #02
** Requires #01-#07
```

## Getting Started

1. **Start with Issue #01**: Establishes the foundation for all other work
2. **Implement Issue #02**: Required for neighbor-based force calculations
3. **Choose Priority Forces**: Implement Issues #03-#06 based on your use cases
4. **Add UI Integration**: Issue #08 for user-facing controls
5. **Polish and Optimize**: Issue #09 for production readiness

## Performance Expectations

| Particle Count | CPU (current) | WebGPU (target) | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1,000 | 60 FPS | 60 FPS | Stable performance |
| 5,000 | 15-30 FPS | 60 FPS | 2-4x improvement |
| 10,000 | 5-10 FPS | 45-60 FPS | 6-12x improvement |
| 25,000 | 1-3 FPS | 30-45 FPS | 15-45x improvement |

## Technical Approach

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API remains unchanged
- **Runtime Selection**: Choose CPU or WebGPU backend at runtime  
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic CPU fallback when WebGPU unavailable
- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate forces individually for testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics to validate improvements

## Browser Support

WebGPU support is rapidly improving:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support (v113+)
- **Firefox**: Experimental support (v125+) 
- **Safari**: Experimental support (v17+)

The system automatically falls back to CPU on unsupported browsers.

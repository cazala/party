# Issue #04: WebGPU Collision Detection and Response

## Goal
Implement high-performance particle collision detection and response system on WebGPU for handling thousands of simultaneous collisions.

## Tasks

### 1. Parallel Collision Detection
- [ ] Port broad-phase collision detection to compute shaders
- [ ] Implement efficient narrow-phase collision testing
- [ ] Add continuous collision detection for fast particles
- [ ] Create collision pair generation and filtering

### 2. Collision Response System
- [ ] Implement momentum transfer calculations on GPU
- [ ] Add mass-aware collision response
- [ ] Create position correction for penetration resolution
- [ ] Handle particle eating mechanics

### 3. Joint-Particle Collision Integration
- [ ] Port joint intersection detection to GPU
- [ ] Implement line-segment collision testing
- [ ] Add constraint-based collision response for joints
- [ ] Create force transfer mechanisms

### 4. Advanced Collision Features
- [ ] Implement collision event generation for game logic
- [ ] Add collision filtering and grouping
- [ ] Create damage/stress calculations for joints
- [ ] Add emergency separation for stuck particles

## Acceptance Criteria
- Handles 1000+ simultaneous collisions at 60fps
- Maintains collision response accuracy
- Joint-particle collisions work correctly
- No particle tunneling or instabilities
